# BottonNavigation UI liquid

A user interface has been designed with jetpack compose and kotlin.

To give it a more pleasant form of interaction with the user you can use this type of navigation, it is usually a little more complex but once you adapt it it can give you that unique touch that you are looking for in your app.

An xml drawable was used to make the background shape of the BottonNavigation, and then we used the RenderEffect api to create the liquid and motion effects.

Extension functions were also added to facilitate development. Review the "UTILS" class.

NOTE: THE EFFECT LOOKS A LITTLE SLOW BECAUSE THE VIDEO WAS RECORDED IN AN EMULATOR, BUT ON REAL DEVICES THERE IS NO PROBLEM.
